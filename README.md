# *EDA-Titanic-dataset*
Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic dataset

This the analysis of the titanic data set which tells about the survival of the passengers of the titanic ship the data set is taken from the kaggle which provides acts as the source for the data set.

# *Library used*

*pandas-*

# *Steps*
 
step-1 *data-pre-processing-*
Data preprocessing is a data mining technique which is used to transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format

step-2 *building logistics model-*
The logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.

step-3 *Training and Predicting*
traing the model to get the survival rate
